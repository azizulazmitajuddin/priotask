# ProEngine

## Getting Started

Make sure to use `yarn` version of `1.22.x` and above, as the repo uses `yarn` version `3+`.

Check `yarn` version.

```
yarn -v
```

Upgrade it with npm (or install it if doesn't have it yet)

```
npm i -g yarn
```

Clone the repo. Then run below to get started.

```

// install all of depedencies
yarn install
```

## Running App

```
npx expo start
```

OR

```
npm run start
```

This will build the package, and start metro server. Once the server is up, start your emulator (if on android), and press "a" OR to start your simulator (if on IOS), press "i" on the keyboard while focusing on the terminal. This will build the app into the emulator and you can proceed.

To run in real devices, you need to download Expo Go apps from [here](<[./apps/mobile/superapp/README.md](https://expo.dev/go)>).

Once the apps ready, you might need to scan the QR code in terminal with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS).

Thank you. Enjoy with ProEngine.
